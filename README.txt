TE: This project is discontinued. No new changes since Feb 2008.

An alpha GUI to easily browse your cellphone files, download/upload photos, ringtones, graphics etc.

I'm playing with my nokia 3220 and 2 CA-42/DKU-5 USB cables, but this must work with any cellphone supported by gammu. In order to get this code working, you have to:

    configure properly your .gammurc,
    put a copy of .gammurc in gammu-php path
    provide the right *nix permissions to user www-data for read /dev/XXXXX and execute gammu 

Feel free to report your findings to fernando at develcuy dot com.
